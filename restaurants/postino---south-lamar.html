                            <h2>About Postino Wine Cafe</h2>
                            <p class="description">Postino Wine Cafe has become an Austin institution for its excellent wine selection, creative bruschetta boards, and effortlessly relaxed atmosphere. Originally founded in Arizona, Postino has expanded across Texas and beyond, bringing their signature concept of affordable wine paired with elevated casual dining to the heart of South Lamar.</p>
                            <p>The concept is brilliantly simple: exceptional wines at accessible prices, creative bruschetta combinations, and an atmosphere that encourages gathering with friends. The South Lamar location has become a neighborhood favorite, drawing crowds for their legendary $5 wine until 5pm deal and staying busy through evening as a prime spot for casual dates and friend groups alike.</p>
                            <p>What makes Postino special for gluten-free diners is their genuine willingness to accommodate with high-quality gluten-free bread options for their famous bruschetta and paninis. While this isn't a dedicated GF kitchen, their staff is well-trained on accommodating dietary needs, making it possible for celiac diners to participate in the Postino experience.</p>
