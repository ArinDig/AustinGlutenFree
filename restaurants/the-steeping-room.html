                            <p>Known for their afternoon tea service—complete with tiered trays of scones, sandwiches, and sweets—The Steeping Room brings a touch of British tradition to Texas with a uniquely Austin twist. The atmosphere is warm and inviting, with natural light streaming through large windows and the gentle hum of conversation creating the perfect backdrop for lingering over a pot of perfectly steeped tea.</p>
                            <p>What makes The Steeping Room special for gluten-free diners is their genuine commitment to providing GF options for their signature afternoon tea experience, including house-made gluten-free scones that rival their traditional counterparts. For those who have been missing the classic tea house experience since going gluten-free, The Steeping Room offers a welcoming solution.</p>

                            <ul class="gf-features">
                                <li><strong>House-Made GF Scones:</strong> Their gluten-free scones are baked in-house and served warm with clotted cream and jam—a rare treat for celiac diners</li>
                                <li><strong>GF Afternoon Tea Service:</strong> Request the gluten-free version of their signature three-tiered afternoon tea when booking</li>
                                <li><strong>GF Bread for Sandwiches:</strong> Available upon request for their tea sandwiches</li>
                                <li><strong>Naturally GF Teas:</strong> All pure, unflavored teas are naturally gluten-free</li>
                                <li><strong>GF-Friendly Salads:</strong> Many salad options can be prepared gluten-free</li>

                            <p><strong>Important Note:</strong> This is not a dedicated gluten-free kitchen. While they take precautions, cross-contamination is possible. Always inform your server about celiac disease. For afternoon tea, request GF options when making your reservation so they can prepare items in advance.</p>

                            <h2>The Afternoon Tea Experience</h2>
                            <p>The Steeping Room's signature offering is their traditional afternoon tea service, an elegant experience that transports you to a classic British tea room:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Traditional Afternoon Tea:</strong> The iconic three-tiered tray featuring fresh scones with clotted cream and jam, delicate finger sandwiches with creative fillings, and a selection of house-made sweets and pastries</li>
                                <li><strong>Gluten-Free Afternoon Tea:</strong> The same elegant experience thoughtfully adapted with GF scones and bread, allowing celiac diners to participate fully in this classic tradition</li>
                                <li><strong>Premium Tea Selection:</strong> Choose from their extensive collection of over 100 loose-leaf teas from around the world</li>
                                <li><strong>Special Occasions:</strong> Perfect for birthdays, bridal showers, baby showers, mother-daughter dates, or any celebration deserving of a touch of elegance</li>
                                <li><strong>Seasonal Variations:</strong> The menu changes seasonally, featuring fresh, local ingredients and creative flavor combinations</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Reservations are highly recommended for afternoon tea, especially on weekends. When booking, clearly mention your gluten-free requirements so the kitchen can prepare your items separately. Arrive with time to browse their tea selection—choosing your tea is part of the experience.</p>
