                        <p>Yes! Austin is fortunate to have several completely dedicated gluten-free establishments where you can order anything on the menu without worry:</p>

                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>How many gluten-free restaurants does Austin have?</h3>
                        <p>Austin has over 35 restaurants with notable gluten-free options, including 7+ that are 100% dedicated gluten-free establishments.

                        <h3>What cuisines tend to be most gluten-free friendly?</h3>
                        <p>Some cuisines are naturally more accommodating for gluten-free diners:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Mexican:</strong> Corn-based dishes are naturally GF (corn tortillas, tamales, etc.)—just watch for flour tortillas and breaded items</li>
                            <li><strong>Japanese:</strong> Sushi, sashimi, and grilled items are often GF, but soy sauce typically contains wheat</li>
                            <li><strong>Thai:</strong> Many dishes use rice noodles and coconut—confirm no soy sauce</li>
                            <li><strong>Mediterranean/Greek:</strong> Grilled meats, vegetables, and rice dishes</li>
                            <li><strong>Indian:</strong> Rice-based dishes and many curries are naturally GF</li>
                            <li><strong>American BBQ:</strong> Smoked meats are often GF—check sauces and rubs</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Cuisines to approach with caution:</strong> Italian (pasta, bread), Chinese (soy sauce in everything), and fast food (shared fryers, breaded items).</p>

                        <h3>What is cross-contamination and why does it matter?</h3>
                        <p>Cross-contamination (also called cross-contact) occurs when gluten-free food comes into contact with gluten-containing ingredients, surfaces, or cooking equipment. This can happen through:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Shared cooking surfaces (grills, cutting boards)</li>
                            <li>Shared cooking oil (deep fryers)</li>
                            <li>Shared utensils (spoons, tongs, spatulas)</li>
                            <li>Airborne flour in the kitchen</li>
                            <li>Contaminated ingredients (bulk bins, shared containers)</li>
                            <li>Staff handling gluten products then GF items without changing gloves</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> For people with celiac disease, even trace amounts of gluten—as little as 10-20 parts per million (about 1/100th of a slice of bread)—can trigger an immune response and damage the small intestine. Symptoms can include digestive issues, fatigue, brain fog, and long-term health complications. This is why dedicated GF kitchens are so important for those with celiac disease.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>What's the difference between "gluten-free options" and a "dedicated gluten-free kitchen"?</h3>
                        <p>This distinction is crucial for celiac safety:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Gluten-free options:</strong> The restaurant offers some GF menu items, but prepares them in a shared kitchen where gluten is also used. Cross-contamination is possible. Many celiac patients can dine safely with proper precautions, but sensitivity levels vary.</li>
                            <li><strong>Dedicated gluten-free kitchen:</strong> No gluten ever enters the kitchen. All ingredients, surfaces, and equipment are gluten-free. Zero cross-contamination risk. Safe for all celiac patients.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>In our restaurant listings, we clearly note which establishments are 100% GF and which offer GF options in a shared kitchen.</p>

                        <h3>Are shared fryers safe for celiac patients?</h3>
                        <p>Generally, no. Shared fryers—where gluten-containing items like breaded chicken or regular fries are fried alongside GF items—pose a significant cross-contamination risk. The oil becomes contaminated with gluten particles.</p>
                        <p><strong>What to ask:</strong> "Do you have a dedicated fryer for gluten-free items, or is it shared?" If shared, skip fried items or ask if they can be prepared another way (grilled, baked).</p>
                        <p>Some restaurants, like dedicated GF establishments, have fryers that only ever fry GF items—those are safe.</p>

                        <h3>Is gluten-free bread safe if toasted in a shared toaster?</h3>
                        <p>No. Shared toasters accumulate crumbs from regular bread, which contaminates GF bread. If a restaurant offers GF bread, ask how it's toasted. Safe options include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A dedicated GF toaster</li>
                            <li>Toaster bags that protect the bread</li>

                        <h4><i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i> Pro Tip: The "Celiac" vs "Preference" Distinction</h4>
                        <p>When communicating with restaurant staff, always say <strong>"I have celiac disease"</strong> rather than just "gluten-free preference." This conveys medical necessity and typically triggers more careful preparation protocols. Staff understand that this isn't about diet trends—it's about your health.</p>

                        <h3>Do Austin restaurants charge extra for gluten-free substitutions?</h3>
                        <p>It varies by restaurant:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Dedicated GF restaurants:</strong> No upcharge—everything is already GF</li>
                            <li><strong>GF bread/bun substitutions:</strong> Usually $1-3 extra</li>
                            <li><strong>GF pasta substitutions:</strong> Often $2-4 extra</li>
                            <li><strong>GF pizza crust:</strong> Typically $3-5 extra</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>While it can feel frustrating to pay extra for a medical necessity, GF ingredients genuinely cost more. The good news is that most Austin restaurants keep upcharges reasonable.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>Can I trust "gluten-free" labels on restaurant menus?</h3>
                        <p>Menu labels are a helpful starting point, but you should still ask questions. A "GF" symbol typically means the dish contains no gluten ingredients, but it doesn't always guarantee the preparation is celiac-safe (no cross-contamination).</p>
                        <p><strong>Always confirm:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>How is the item prepared?</li>
                            <li>Are there any shared surfaces or fryers?</li>
                            <li>Can they take extra precautions for celiac disease?</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>In our experience, Austin restaurants are generally honest about their GF labeling, but verification is always smart.</p>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>Are food trucks safe for gluten-free dining?</h3>
                        <p>Food trucks can be tricky. Small spaces mean shared prep areas and limited ability to prevent cross-contamination. However, Austin has some excellent GF-friendly trucks:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Look for trucks with simple menus where GF is easier to control</li>
                            <li>Ask about dedicated prep areas and glove-changing practices</li>
                            <li>Trucks serving naturally GF cuisines (tacos with corn tortillas, grilled meats) may be safer</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>When in doubt, stick to brick-and-mortar restaurants where there's more space for safe food handling.</p>

                        <h3>What about breakfast/brunch spots? Isn't everything bread and pancakes?</h3>
                        <p>Brunch can be challenging, but Austin has great options:</p>
                        <ul>

                        </ul>
                        <p>Many Mexican restaurants also serve excellent breakfast tacos on corn tortillas—just confirm the tortillas are 100% corn.</p>
